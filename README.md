Medical History Tracking App

First things first and important things first: I AM NOT A DOCTOR NOR SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD.

This is so I can track my stuff. I have plenty of health issues and maintaining a list in Notes.app is just getting painful.
Data is meant to be stored in the cloud. Because this is extremely personal information I don't want to run a server to handle anything. The end goal is going to have it sync to the cloud so you can open it on a new phone should you lose your old phone as well as open it on your iPad or Macbook (or whatever). Perhaps one day it'll be possible to be cross platform via an API or something so Apple will let folks on Windows, Linux, BSD, etc access that data.

## Goals

Below are the goals I have for the app. A somewhat vague end-game.

### Appointments and history

This is to help track appointments (duh) but also add them in to the Calendar as well as have notes such as questions to ask the doctors or notable things to bring up.

It's use is also to keep a history of these appointments readily accessible.

This references the doctors list below but is not required to use it. You can just use a generic name and not link it.

Ideally I would like to see if I can find a way to have links to various bits in Apple Health so if you have smart tech (e.g. smart blood pressure cuff) - you can go directly to that to show a cardiologist a pattern you've discovered without having to hunt it down in the app. Or perhaps a link to your most recent blood lab to show other doctors.

### Doctors

A list of doctors, their addresses, phone numbers, and notes. This is linked to appoinments.
One should be able to click on a doctor and see the appointment history with that doctor as well as show icons for major events (such as a medication changes)

It would also be nice to see if I can pull blood labs from Apple Health so I can email those to other doctors (e.g. share cardiologist blood lab to your general practicioner)

### Exporting Data

Exporting data, I feel, is a must so you can have a printout to hand to doctors - such as handing them a list of medications or showing a family history. The formats will be pdf, html, and JSON (should someone care to import in to another app)

I, for example, have some heart issues and being able to share that with my sister so she can show the doctor and they can check to see if she also has those same problems would be amazing.

### Family medical history

A list of medical history, duh, but I've found it's very difficult to remember who has what. E.g.: Did my grandmother say she has glaucoma or was it cataracts or did they just remark on maybe having them?

Perhaps one day I'll also add the ability to help track doctors and appointments for other family members (e.g. helping your parents or grandparents out and being able to track notes and share information with the family)

### Medications list

Do I really need to enumerate the details on this?

### Surgeries

A list of surgeries because I have issues remembering dates as I get older. It'd also be handy to ask my parents about history when I was very young so it can be stored (e.g. having my tonsils taken out)

It'd also be nice to have notes and be able to reference hospitals in Apple Maps?
